This repository contains the code and analysis developed for my thesis on rural development in Italy, using data from the World Bank Rural Development dataset.
The main goal of this project is to study the temporal behavior of selected rural development indicators for Italy and to build forecasting models. The analysis is carried out in two stages:
- Statistical forecasting, using classical time series models such as ARIMA and SARIMAX.
- Machine learning forecasting, using recurrent neural networks.

The predicted trends are then compared with the main European policy frameworks, including the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP 2023–2027) and the European Green Deal, in order to assess whether Italy’s rural development trajectory is consistent with the objectives set at the EU level.
